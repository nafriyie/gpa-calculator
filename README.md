# GPA-Calculator
A Java program to calculate your semester gpa and cumulative gpa.

I created this program as my first real side project because I wanted to strengthen my Java skills and cover topics skipped over in my class.  Another reason I was inspired to make this program was to innovate on my basic calculator I made in my first year of college to see my improvement.

In this program, I used the Scanner class to read the credits and grade the user input for each class. I used try/catch statements to ensure that the user didn't input the wrong data type for each question. To calculate the semester and cumulative GPA, I used do-while loops so users could input as many classes as they needed. I used OOP to create the Semester GPA object so that in the main method, I can call the object as many times as I need to formulate the cumulative GPA.
